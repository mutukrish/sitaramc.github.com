<h1><a name="rules"></a> access rules</h1>

<p>In the following description, "user" means "user or a <a href="groups.html">group</a> that
he/she is a member of", and "repo" means "repo, or a group that it is a member
of, or a (<a href="wild.html">wild</a> repo) pattern that matches it, or a group that contains a
pattern that matches it".</p>

<h2>what do rules look like</h2>

<p>Here's an example ruleset.</p>

<pre><code>@staff          =   dilbert alice wally bob

repo foo
    RW+         =   dilbert     # line 1
    RW+ dev     =   alice       # line 2
    -           =   wally       # line 3
    RW  temp/   =   @staff      # line 4
    R           =   ashok       # line 5
</code></pre>

<p>A rule line has the structure</p>

<pre><code>&lt;permission&gt; &lt;zero or more refexes&gt; = &lt;one or more users/user groups&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The most commonly used permissions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>R, for read only
</li>
<li>RW, for push existing ref or create new ref
</li>
<li>RW+, for  "push -f" or ref deletion allowed (i.e., destroy
information)
</li>
<li><code>-</code> (the minus sign), to <strong>deny</strong> access.
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also other, less commonly used, <a href="write-types.html">types of permissions</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="refex.html">refex</a> is an expression that matches the ref (i.e., branch or tag) being
pushed.</p>

<p><font color="gray">You can also use <a href="vref.html">virtual refs</a> to perform extra
checks and controls that you can't do with just the normal ref (like
refs/heads/master) being pushed.  The most common example is restricting
pushes by dir/file name, but there are lots of other possibilities.</font></p>

<h2>how are the rules checked</h2>

<p>Note that gitolite first <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">accumulates the rules</a> before checking
access.</p>

<h3>read access -- clone, fetch, archive</h3>

<p>Read access is checked once, just before passing control to git-upload-pack or
git-archive-pack.  At this point gitolite only knows the repo name, the user
name, and the fact that it is a read operation.</p>

<p>If the set of rules for this user on this repo has at least one rule where the
permission field contains an "R", access is granted.  If there are none,
access is denied.</p>

<p>The <a href="refex.html">refex</a> field is ignored for this check.  (Git does not allow
distinguishing one ref from another for access control during read
operations).</p>

<p>Deny rules (the "-" permission) are ignored for this check.  In our example,
line 3 does not prevent wally from cloning the repo, because line 4 permits
it.  (This is the default behaviour.  You can change that by using the
<a href="rules.html#deny-rules">deny-rules</a> option).</p>

<h3>write access -- push</h3>

<p>Write access is checked twice, once before passing control to
git-receive-pack, and once from within the update hook.</p>

<p>The <strong>first check</strong> is identical to the one for read access, except of course
the permission field must contain a "W".  As before, deny rules are ignored,
(line 3 does not prevent wally from trying to push because line 4 allows it),
and you can override that using the <a href="rules.html#deny-rules">deny-rules</a> option.</p>

<p>The <a href="refex.html">refex</a> field is ignored for this check, because at this point we don't
know what refs are going to be pushed.</p>

<p>The <strong>second check</strong> happens from within the update hook.  This check is much
more complex because deny rules are considered, which in turn means the
<em>sequence</em> of the rules makes a difference now.</p>

<p>Also, this time, git supplies us with three more pieces of information: the
name of the ref being updated (like "refs/heads/master"), the old SHA, and the
new SHA.  This information is sufficient to determine whether this is a normal
push or a forced, (a.k.a rewind), push.  A normal push requires the permission
field to contain a "W", while a forced push requires it to contain a "+".</p>

<p>Here's how the actual rule matching happens:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>all the rules for this user and this repo are <a href="rules.html#rule-accum">collected</a> and
examined <em>in the sequence</em> they appear in the conf file</p></li>
<li><p>for each rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the ref does not match the <a href="refex.html">refex</a>, the rule is skipped.
</li>
<li>If it's a deny rule, access is denied and the matching stops.
</li>
<li>If the permission field matches the specific <a href="write-types.html">type of
write</a> operation, access is allowed and the matching
stops.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If no rule ends with a decision, ("fallthru"), access is denied.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now all you need is to understand how <a href="refex.html">refex</a> matching happens and how the
permissions match the various <a href="write-types.html">types of write operations</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="permsum"></a> summary of permissions</h2>

<p>The full set of permissions, in regex syntax, is <code>-|R|RW+?C?D?M?</code>.  This
expands to one of <code>-</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>RW</code>, <code>RW+</code>, <code>RWC</code>, <code>RW+C</code>, <code>RWD</code>, <code>RW+D</code>, <code>RWCD</code>,
or <code>RW+CD</code>, all but the first two optionally followed by an <code>M</code>.  And by now
you know what they all mean.</p>

<h3><a name="rule-accum"></a> rule accumulation</h3>

<p>Gitolite was meant to collect rules from multiple places and apply them all.
For example:</p>

<pre><code># we have 3 specifically named FOSS projects, but we also consider any
# project in the foss/ directory to be FOSS.
@FOSS-projects  =   git gitolite linux foss/..*

# similarly for proprietary projects
@prop-projects  =   foo bar baz prop/..*

# our users are divided into staff, interns, and bosses
@staff          =   alice dilbert wally
@interns        =   ashok
@bosses         =   PHB

# we have certain policies.  The first is that FOSS projects are readable
# by everyone
repo @FOSS-projects
    R   =   @all

# the second is that bosses can read any repo if they wish to
repo @all
    R   =   @bosses

# now we have specific rules for specific projects
repo git
    ...some rules...

...etc...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, for each user+repo combination, several rules will apply.
Gitolite combines them all into one list (in the sequence they are found in
the conf file), before applying the access checks.</p>

<p>This extends to patterns also.  For example, if you have this:</p>

<pre><code>repo foss/apache
    ...some rules...
</code></pre>

<p>then, because this repo fits the pattern <code>foss/..*</code>, it is considered part of
the @FOSS-projects group, so all the rules that apply to that group are in
play when someone accesses foss/apache.</p>

<p>This is what we meant by "repo, or a group that it is a member of, or a
(<a href="wild.html">wild</a> repo) pattern that matches it, or a group that contains a pattern
that matches it", up at the top of this document.</p>

<h3><a name="deny-rules"></a> applying deny rules during the first check</h3>

<p>The access rules above show that you cannot make an exception to a group for
the first check, i.e., you cannot lock Wally out of read access that other
members of @staff have, because read access does not look at "deny" rules by
default.</p>

<p>This section will show how to make that happen.  We'll use <a href="external.html">'gitweb' and
'daemon'</a> instead of Wally, but it could, of course, be any user or
group or list (like, say, '@interns') that needs to be restricted.</p>

<p>We'll consider two cases.  In the first case, the "secret" repos are fewer in
number, and are enumerated in some group called @secret for convenience.</p>

<pre><code># put this at or near the top of the conf file, or at least before any
# rules that give 'gitweb' and 'daemon' any kind of access

repo @secret
    -   =   gitweb daemon
    option deny-rules = 1
    # make sure you do not set deny-rules to 0 for these repos later
</code></pre>

<p>Now imagine, worst case, you have this somewhere after the above:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    R   =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>The "deny-rules" option applies, as you can see, only to the secret repos.  It
forces gitolite to pay attention to any deny rules, and since the deny rule
for those two users appears first, access is denied to them.</p>

<p>The second case is where the "open" repos are fewer.</p>

<pre><code># put this at or near the top of the conf file, or at least before any
# rules that give 'gitweb' and 'daemon' any access

repo @all
    -   =   gitweb daemon
    option deny-rules = 1

repo @open
    R   =   gitweb daemon
    option deny-rules = 0
    # make sure you do not set deny-rules to 1 for these repos later
</code></pre>

<p>To see why this works, you need to remember that for <a href="options.html">options</a> and
<a href="git-config.html">config</a> lines, a later setting <a href="git-config.html#override_conf">overrides</a> earlier
ones.  So we set it to 1 for all repos, then selectively set it to 0 for some.</p>

<p>This means the "deny-rules" option applies to <em>all the repos except the "open"
repos</em>, so the deny rule kicks in and denies access to those repos for those
users.</p>

<p>Note that, any time deny rules are in play, the order matters; the <code>-</code> rule
must come <em>before</em> the <code>R</code> rule.  That is why the comments tell you to put
that stuff at the top of the conf.  Also, as a reminder, refexes are ignored
for the first check.</p>
