<hr />

<p>Gitolite has a huge bunch of existing features that gradually need to moved
over.  Plus you may want to write your own programs to interact with it.</p>

<p><strong>This document is about <em>writing</em> hooks, commands, triggers, VREFS, and sugar
scripts.  <em>Installing</em> them, including "where and how", is described
<a href="cust.html#localcode">here</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>environment variables and other inputs</h2>

<p>In general, the following environment variables should always be available:</p>

<pre><code>GL_BINDIR
GL_REPO_BASE
GL_ADMIN_BASE
</code></pre>

<p>Commands invoked by a remote client will also have <code>GL_USER</code> set.  Hooks will
have <code>GL_REPO</code> also set.</p>

<p>Finally, note that triggers get a lot of relevant information from gitolite as
arguments; see <a href="triggers.html">here</a> for details.</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>

<h3>the shell API</h3>

<p>The following commands exist to help you write shell scripts that interact
easily with gitolite.  Each of them responds to <code>-h</code> so please run that for
more info.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>gitolite access</code> to check access rights given repo, user, type of access
(R, W, ...) and refname (optional).  Example use: src/commands/desc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite creator</code> to get/check the creator of a repo.  Example use:
src/commands/desc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite git-config</code> to check gitolite options or git config variables
directly from gitolite's "compiled" output, (i.e., without looking at the
actual <code>repo.git/config</code> file or using the <code>git config</code> command).  Example
use: src/triggers/post-compile/update-gitweb-access-list.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite query-rc</code> to check the value of an RC variable.  Example use:
src/commands/desc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you can also look at the comments in src/lib/Gitolite/Easy.pm
(the perl API module) for ideas.</p>

<h3>the perl API</h3>

<p>...is implemented by Gitolite::Easy; the comments in src/lib/Gitolite/Easy.pm
serve as documentation.</p>

<p>Note that some of the perl functions called by Easy.pm will change the current
directory to something else, without saving and restoring the directory.
Patches (to Easy.pm <em>only</em>) welcome.</p>

<h2>writing your own...</h2>

<h3>...commands</h3>

<p>Commands are standalone programs, in any language you like.  They simply
receive the arguments you append.  In addition, the env var <code>GL_USER</code> is
available if it is being run remotely.  src/commands/desc is the best example
at present.</p>

<h3>...hooks</h3>

<h4>anything but the update hook</h4>

<p>If you want to add any hook other than the update hook, 'man githooks' is all
you need.</p>

<h4>update hook</h4>

<p>If you want to add additional <code>update</code> hook functionality, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write and test your update hook separately from gitolite.</p></li>
<li><p>Now add the code as a VREF (see <a href="cust.html#localcode">here</a> for details).  Let's say
you called it "foo".</p></li>
<li><p>To call your new update hook to all accesses for all repos, add this to
the end of your conf file:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    -       VREF/foo        =   @all
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>As you probably guessed, you can make your additional update hooks more
selective, applying them only to some repos / users / combinations.</p>

<p>Note: a normal update hook expects 3 arguments (ref, old SHA, new SHA).  A
VREF will get those three, followed by at least 4 more.  Your VREF should just
ignore the extra args.</p>

<h3>...trigger programs</h3>

<p>Trigger programs run at specific points in gitolite's execution, with specific
arguments being passed to them.  See the <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a> page for details.</p>

<p>You can write programs that are both manually runnable as well as callable by
trigger events, especially if they don't <em>need</em> any arguments.</p>

<h3>..."sugar"</h3>

<p>Syntactic sugar helpers are NOT complete, standalone, programs.  They must
include a perl sub called <code>sugar_script</code> that takes in a listref, and returns
a listref.  The listrefs point to a list that contains the entire conf file
(with all <a href="syntax.html#include">include</a> processing already done).  You create a new list with
contents modified as you like and return a ref to it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of examples in src/syntactic-sugar.</p>

<h2>appendix 1: notes on the INPUT trigger</h2>

<p>Note: some of this won't make sense if you haven't read about <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a>.</p>

<p>The INPUT trigger sequence is designed to set or change environment variables
or the argument list.  (Side note: this means INPUT triggers have to be
written as perl modules; they cannot be standalone scripts).  This is a very
powerful idea so an extended description may be useful.</p>

<p>Sshd invokes gitolite-shell with the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var containing
the git/gitolite command and one argument: the gitolite username.</p>

<ul>
<li>see <a href="glssh.html">this</a> for details on the latter</li>
<li>the <em>first</em> thing gitolite does in smart http mode is to use the
REMOTE_USER and the CGI variables that apache provides to <em>construct</em>
a fake argument list and a fake SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var, so the
rest of the code can stay the same</li>
</ul>

<p>The INPUT trigger is then run.  The purpose of the input trigger is to ensure
that the first argument <em>is</em> the gitolite username, and that the
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND env var contains the actual command to execute.  It can
also be used to set up any other environment variables that you may decide you
need.</p>

<p>Wait... didn't we say that's what gitolite-shell gets anyway, just now?</p>

<p>Well, we lied a bit there; it's not always true!</p>

<p>For example, if <a href="sts.html#giving-shell">this</a> feature is used, the first argument <em>may</em>
be "-s", with the username in the <em>second</em> argument.  Shell.pm deals with
that.  <font color="gray">(Order matters.  If you use this feature, put the
<code>'Shell::input',</code> line ahead of the others, since it is the only one prepared
to deal with username not being the first argument).</font></p>

<p>If you look at CpuTime.pm, you'll see that it's <code>input()</code> function doesn't set
or change anything, but does set a package variable to record the start time.
Later, when the same module's <code>post_git()</code> function is invoked, it uses this
variable to determine elapsed time.</p>

<p><em>(This is a very nice and simple example of how you can implement features by
latching onto multiple events and sharing data to do something)</em>.</p>

<p>You can even change the reponame the user sees, behind his back.  Alias.pm
handles that.</p>

<p>Finally, as an exercise for the reader, consider how you would create a brand
new env var that contains the <em>comment</em> field of the ssh pubkey that was used
to gain access, using the information <a href="sts.html#kfn">here</a>.</p>
